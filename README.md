## Libraries

1. React-hook-form - for comfortable and clean work with the form;
2. Yup - for form validation;
3. Redux-toolkit - as for me, such a big state manager is not needed in this application, but Redux was indicated in the job description, so I decided to demonstrate my skills xD;
4. React-hot-toast - for pretty notifications;
5. React-router-dom - for routing on web app;
6. Tailwindcss - for UI;

## Getting started
